AirBnB_clone - the first step towards building your first full web application.

# Other related projects projects: HTML/CSS templating, database storage, API, front-end integration etc.

# Benefits of each task:

# put in place a parent class (called BaseModel) to take care of the initialization, serialization and deserialization of your future instances
# create a simple flow of serialization/deserialization: Instance <-> Dictionary <-> JSON string <-> file
# create all classes used for AirBnB (User, State, City, Place etc.) that inherit from BaseModel
# create the first abstracted storage engine of the project: File storage.
# create all unittests to validate all our classes and storage engine

# Command interpreter: Ref. Shell Project

# Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)
# Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc.
# Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc.)
# Update attributes of an object
# Destroy an object
